# Chapter 1 Lesson 1 - Baseline Parameters and Basic Prompting

The goal of this lesson is to get started generating locally and to cover the most important aspects of prompting that have the largest impact on your results.

This lesson assumes you have already installed either forge, reForge, or ComfyUI. I recommend reForge if you're planning on using Illustrious or ComfyUI if you're planning on using Z-Image. [Stability Matrix](https://lykos.ai/) is a turn-key solution to the installation process, so if you don't have an install yet just use that.

It's also recommended that you read the [course introduction](../../README.md) to get a better understanding of other assumptions and how the lessons fit together.
