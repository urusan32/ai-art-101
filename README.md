# ai-art-101
A series of 101-level articles on AI Art.

The articles are organized into thematic chapters and individual lessons. Most of the lessons are standard lessons designed to be taken one at a time in order, but some lessons are marked as "Additional" and will assume complete knowledge of the standard lessons. Therefore, the intended order is all standard lessons in order followed by the additional lessons in any order.
